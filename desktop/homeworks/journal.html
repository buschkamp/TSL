		<h1>Constant Failure. In a good way.</h1>
			<p>To put it scientifically, so far I've learned a shit-ton. And most of those learnings have come from failing over...and over...and over. And as my headline would indicate, I mean that in a good way. How often in your day-to-day life do you get to say "Well, fuck it. I'm just going to break this and find out what happens." Not too much for me because like most people on Earth, I like being right. I like knowing my stuff. So this has been a great opportunity to constantly experiment, to constantly fail and to constantly redeem myself by finding the answer in my code, or let's face it: On Google.But the truth is this: divs and classes still freak me out. (Time to review that stuff.) And Github makes me say "fuck!"...a lot.(But hey, I installed it all by meeself.) That said, I'm looking to forward to failing Box Model and Positioning. Go Team Fail!
